Movies V3
=========

This project will contain all features from [V2](https://github.com/Spezelechse/movies-v2) and add some new ones. The biggest difference to V2 will be that the backend is based on [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/) and the fronted on [jquery](http://jquery.com/).

Some of the new features will be:
- multilingual (V2 was just german)
- import data from imdb with help of [imdbphp](http://projects.izzysoft.de/trac/imdbphp/wiki/WikiStart)
- responsive(ish) design
- single page application (the whole page or just parts of it, not sure at the moment :) )
- improved database design

I've never worked with Zend so the inital build will take some time.
